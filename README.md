# Yet Another Todo List App

This is a simple todo list app that I made to practice using React with TypeScript.

## Features

- Add a new todo item
- Delete a todo item

That's it. Since nobody needs another todo list app, I won't be adding any more features to this project.

## Technical Details

- Using props in TypeScript
- Using a data model (a description of an object)
- Form submission
- refs and useRef
- State management (locally and by using the Context API)
